# My Maven Repository
This maven repository contains stuff that I written or that I need to be on maven.

**DISCLAIMER:** Some packages are republished because thier original maven repository wasn't working propertly. Here's a list of the modules that I do not own in any way that are hosted here:
- org.lwgl:lwgl-freetype
- org.lwgl:lwgl-glfw
- org.lwgl:lwgl-jemalloc
